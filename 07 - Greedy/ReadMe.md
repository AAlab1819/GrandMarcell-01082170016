## 946A : Partition 

You are given a sequence a consisting of n integers. You may partition this sequence into two sequences b and c in such a way that every element belongs exactly to one of these sequences.

Let B be the sum of elements belonging to b, and C be the sum of elements belonging to c (if some of these sequences is empty, then its sum is 0). What is the maximum possible value of B - C?  
**Input**<br>
The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in a.  
The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an ( - 100 ≤ ai ≤ 100) — the elements of sequence a.  
**Output**<br>
Print the maximum possible value of B - C, where B is the sum of elements of sequence b, and C is the sum of elements of sequence c.
