## 946A : Partition 

You are given a sequence a consisting of n integers. You may partition this sequence into two sequences b and c in such a way that every element belongs exactly to one of these sequences.

Let B be the sum of elements belonging to b, and C be the sum of elements belonging to c (if some of these sequences is empty, then its sum is 0). What is the maximum possible value of B - C?  
**Input**<br>
The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in a.  
The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an ( - 100 ≤ ai ≤ 100) — the elements of sequence a.  
**Output**<br>
Print the maximum possible value of B - C, where B is the sum of elements of sequence b, and C is the sum of elements of sequence c.

## 978B : File Name 

Determine the minimum number of characters to remove from the file name so after that the name does not contain "xxx" as a substring. Print 0 if the file name does not initially contain a forbidden substring "xxx".

You can delete characters in arbitrary positions (not necessarily consecutive). If you delete a character, then the length of a string is reduced by 
1
. For example, if you delete the character in the position 
2
 from the string "exxxii", then the resulting string is "exxii".
 
**Input**<br>
The first line contains integer n(3≤n≤100) — the length of the file name.

The second line contains a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters only — the file name.

**Output**<br>
Print the minimum number of characters to remove from the file name so after that the name does not contain "xxx" as a substring. If initially the file name dost not contain a forbidden substring "xxx", print 0.
