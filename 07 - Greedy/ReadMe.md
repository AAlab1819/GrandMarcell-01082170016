## 946A : Partition 

You are given a sequence a consisting of n integers. You may partition this sequence into two sequences b and c in such a way that every element belongs exactly to one of these sequences.

Let B be the sum of elements belonging to b, and C be the sum of elements belonging to c (if some of these sequences is empty, then its sum is 0). What is the maximum possible value of B - C?  
**Input**<br>
The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in a.  
The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an ( - 100 ≤ ai ≤ 100) — the elements of sequence a.  
**Output**<br>
Print the maximum possible value of B - C, where B is the sum of elements of sequence b, and C is the sum of elements of sequence c.

## 978B : File Name 

Determine the minimum number of characters to remove from the file name so after that the name does not contain "xxx" as a substring. Print 0 if the file name does not initially contain a forbidden substring "xxx".

You can delete characters in arbitrary positions (not necessarily consecutive). If you delete a character, then the length of a string is reduced by 
1
. For example, if you delete the character in the position 
2
 from the string "exxxii", then the resulting string is "exxii".
 
**Input**<br>
The first line contains integer n(3≤n≤100) — the length of the file name.

The second line contains a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters only — the file name.

**Output**<br>
Print the minimum number of characters to remove from the file name so after that the name does not contain "xxx" as a substring. If initially the file name dost not contain a forbidden substring "xxx", print 0.

## 731B : Coupons and Discounts

Sereja wants to order exactly ai pizzas on the i-th day while using only discounts and coupons. Note, that he will never buy more pizzas than he need for this particular day. Help him determine, whether he can buy the proper amount of pizzas each day if he is allowed to use only coupons and discounts. Note, that it's also prohibited to have any active coupons after the end of the day n.

**Input**<br>
The first line of input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the number of training sessions.

The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 10 000) — the number of teams that will be present on each of the days

**Output**<br>
If there is a way to order pizzas using only coupons and discounts and do not buy any extra pizzas on any of the days, then print "YES" (without quotes) in the only line of output. Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).
