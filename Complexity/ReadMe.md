## 492B: Vanya and Lanterns

This problems asking us to find the minimum radius of a lantern so that it can cover all the streets.
The first line input is the number of lanterns and the length of the street.
The next line will be the location of the lanterns in the streets.
The solution here is first to count the distance from 0 to first lantern, then the edge of the street to the last lantern, and the biggest gap between lanterns by sorting the location of the lantern in non-decreasing way. We then divide the biggest gap by two to find the radius, because it is in between two lanterns.
Then we find the greatest number between those three and print it.
