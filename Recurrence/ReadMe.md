# Week 04

## 268B : Buttons
The problem here is to count how many times Manao must push a button until the lock is unlocked. He will act in an optimal way and we must calculate the number for the worst case scenario. \
The only input will be the number of buttons to open. \
The output will be the number he need to push a button. \
The solution here is to loop it and at last add with the correct key.

## 598D : Igor and The Museum
The problem here is we must calculate the maximum number of picture that Igor can seeFor several starting positions. Igor is able to see the picture only if he is in the cell adjacent to the wall with this picture. Igor have a lot of time, so he will examine every picture he can see. \
First line of the input contains three integers n, m and k (3 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 100 000)) — the museum dimensions and the number of starting positions to process. \
Each of the next n lines contains m symbols '.', '*' — the description of the museum. It is guaranteed that all border cells are impassable, so Igor can't go out from the museum. \
Each of the last k lines contains two integers x and y (1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m) — the row and the column of one of Igor's starting positions respectively. Rows are numbered from top to bottom, columns — from left to right. It is guaranteed that all starting positions are empty cells.
