## 268B: Buttons
The problem here is to count how many times Manao must push a button until the lock is unlocked. He will act in an optimal way and we must calculate the number for the worst case scenario. \
The only input will be the number of buttons to open. \
The output will be the number he need to push a button. \
The solution here is to loop it and at last add with the correct key.
